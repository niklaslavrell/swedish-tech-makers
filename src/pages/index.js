    <h1>Swedish Tech Makers ðŸš€</h1>
    <p>We are private community of tech makers that strive for creating more fun lives through collaboration and creation.
      We are active, driven, questioning and creative - producers rather than consumers.
      We love talking about product creation and side-projects, freelancing and escaping employment, remote work and nomadic lifestyle.
      Get in touch at hi@swedishtechmakers.com.</p>
